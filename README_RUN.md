# One-Line Link Game (Dynamic One-Touch)

This project was generated by the AI Assistant. It contains all the necessary scripts and a bootstrapper to run the game immediately.

## How to Run

1. **Open Unity**: Open the folder `e:\MyWork\ConnetGame\UnityClient` as a Unity Project.
2. **Setup Scene**:
   - Create a new **2D Scene**.
   - The `GameBootstrapper.cs` script will automatically generate the UI and start the game when you hit Play.
   - *Optional*: Create an empty GameObject and attach `GameManager` manually if you want to configure settings (like Level size) in the Inspector. The Bootstrapper only runs if it doesn't find a GameManager.
3. **Assets**:
   - A background image was generated at `Assets/Sprites/bg_game.png`.
   - Other UI elements (Cells) use code-generated colors by default. You can replace them by assigning Sprites to the generated Prefabs or Scripts.

## Controls
- **Click/Touch & Drag**: Connect the "Orange" cells.
- **Rules**: connect all targets without overlapping (unless Backtracking).
- **Win**: Visit all targets.

## Project Structure
- `Assets/Scripts/Core`: Main logic (GameManager, Bootstrapper).
- `Assets/Scripts/Data`: Level data and Enum definitions.
- `Assets/Scripts/UI`: Grid and Line rendering logic.
